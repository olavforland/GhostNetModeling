# GhostNetModeling
Repository for the project in the course TTK4854 - Robotic Ocean Waste Removal

The repository consists of two main folders: `LobsterTrapModeling` and `FishingNetSimulation`. They contain two different modeling pipelines: Modeling of lobster traps, which are assumed to not move around when dropped in the ocean, and modeling of lost fishing nets, which are assumed to move with the ocean currents.
